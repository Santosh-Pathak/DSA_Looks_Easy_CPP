    Graph Representation and Topological Sort in Directed Graph:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    This program represents a directed graph using an **Adjacency List** and provides functionality
    for computing the topological sort of the graph using Depth-First Search (DFS).

    Data Structures Used:
    ----------------------
    1. **unordered_map<int, list<int>> adj**:
        - `adj` is an unordered map where each key represents a node (vertex), and the value is a list of integers.
          Each integer in the list represents a neighboring node.
        - This structure represents the adjacency list of the graph.

    Algorithms:
    -----------
    1. Topological Sort in Directed Graphs
    
    Definition:
    ------------
    Topological sorting (or topological order) of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of its vertices
    such that for every directed edge \( uv \) from vertex \( u \) to vertex \( v \), \( u \) comes before \( v \) in the ordering.
    In simpler terms, it orders the vertices so that every directed edge goes from an earlier vertex to a later vertex in the sequence.

    Characteristics:
    -----------------
    - **Only for DAGs**: Topological sorting is only possible for Directed Acyclic Graphs. If the graph contains cycles, no topological ordering exists.
    - **Not Unique**: There can be multiple valid topological sorts for a given DAG.

    Applications:
    --------------
    - **Task Scheduling**: Determining the order of tasks given their dependencies.
    - **Course Prerequisites**: Finding an order to take courses where some courses are prerequisites for others.
    - **Build Systems**: In software build systems to resolve dependencies between various modules.

    Implementation Using DFS:
    ---------------------------
    Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of how topological sort can be implemented using Depth-First Search (DFS) in C++:

    1. **DFS Traversal**: Perform DFS on the graph starting from each unvisited node.
    2. **Stack for Result**: Use a stack to store the nodes in the order of their finishing times. Nodes that are finished last are pushed to the stack first, which ensures that they appear first in the topological order.
    3. **Visit Each Node**: Mark nodes as visited to avoid processing the same node multiple times.

    Functionality:
    --------------
    1. **addEdge(int u, int v, bool direction)**:
        - Adds an edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
        - The `direction` parameter specifies whether the edge is directed (`1`) or undirected (`0`).

    2. **printList()**:
        - Prints the adjacency list of the graph, showing each node and its neighbors.

    3. **topologicalSortDFS(int src, unordered_map<int, bool> &visited, stack<int> &s)**:
        - Computes the topological sort starting from node `src` using DFS.
        - Marks nodes as visited and pushes them onto a stack in reverse finish order.
